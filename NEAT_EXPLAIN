Genome: In NEAT, a genome is a data structure that encodes a neural network (its structure and weights).
Each genome represents a possible solution (a neural network) that can play the game

NEAT stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies.
It is an algorithm that evolves both the structure and weights of neural networks using genetic algorithms.

How NEAT works:
Starts with simple neural networks (few connections).
Uses genetic operations (mutation, crossover) to evolve networks over generations.
Networks that perform better (higher fitness, e.g., higher Flappy Bird score) are more likely to be selected for the next generation.
Over time, networks become more complex and better at the task.

```Each genome is a neural network controlling a bird.
The NEAT algorithm runs many birds at once, each with its own neural network.
Birds that survive longer and score higher are considered "fitter".
NEAT evolves the population of genomes to improve performance over generations.
